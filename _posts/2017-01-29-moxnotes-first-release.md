Yesterday at 1AM [Mox] is finally online! It has been in development for nearly 2 months now. Let's take a simple look at what I got done so far.

<br>

##Major working features:
1. All of the core functionality that is related to your notes. Create notes, create tags, modify them, delete them, filter them, import and export.
2. All of the user authentication and billing stuff. You can register, log in, log out, update your billing information, cancel the subscription, request a password reset, request an email verification resend, update your email.

<br>

And of course â€“

<br>

##Major upcoming features:
1. Free, local version of Mox for people that don't need to syncing feature.
2. Design for mobile and tablet

<br>

It goes without saying that a lot of bug fixes will be included. Small tweaks like rendering urls as links in the notes are up next as well. In the next changelog I will attempt to log bug fixes and small tweaks along with the major features.

<br>

Alright, it's late here and I need to get up very early tomorrow. Good night (the hardworking free elf wishes you a good night too)!
